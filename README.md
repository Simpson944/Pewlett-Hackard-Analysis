# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## The following analysis focuses in on Pewlett Hackard's employee population, specifically noting risk associated with the retiring population. 
### Key Findings:
#### - 5% of current employees fall under the companyâ€™s mentor guidelines
#### - 17% of current employees are within considered range for upcoming retirement 
#### - Development department has the highest % of retiring employees at 4% of the total retiring force 
#### - The title of "Senior Engineer" has the highest % of retiring employees at 35% of the total retiring force 

### 41,380 roles will need to be filled from employees retiring 
### There is currently 1 mentor per 26 TM's that will need to be onboarded. It is my assessment that there is not a sufficient mentor force to cover the need 

### An additional table that was built in order to view retiring employees by department
